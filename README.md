# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

This is my submission for the Capstone portion of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone, developed by Yan Luo and Joseph Santarcangelo.

The scenario is that we are imagining we are a part of a company competing with SpaceX. They say the Falcon 9 rocket launches cost $62 million, in contrast with the estimated $165 from the competition. We are to predict if the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land, so that we know the cost of the launch. 

The steps involved are:
1) [Data collection](https://github.com/joeastro5/IBM_Capstone/blob/main/data-collection-api.ipynb) with SpaceX REST API.
2) [Web scraping](https://github.com/joeastro5/IBM_Capstone/blob/main/data-collection-scraping.ipynb) from Wikipedia for launch records.
3) [Data wrangling](https://github.com/joeastro5/IBM_Capstone/blob/main/data-collection-wrangling.ipynb) : some EDA to examine the types of orbits
4) [EDA with SQL](https://github.com/joeastro5/IBM_Capstone/blob/main/jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera_sqllite.ipynb)
5) [EDA with Pandas and Matplotlib](https://github.com/joeastro5/IBM_Capstone/blob/main/jupyter-labs-eda-dataviz.ipynb.jupyterlite.ipynb)
6) [Interactive visual analytics](https://github.com/joeastro5/IBM_Capstone/blob/main/lab_jupyter_launch_site_location.jupyterlite.ipynb) with Folium (may need [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org) for interactivity)
7) [Interactive dashboard](https://github.com/joeastro5/IBM_Capstone/blob/main/spacex_dash_app.py) with Plotly Dash.
8) [Machine learning](https://github.com/joeastro5/IBM_Capstone/blob/main/SpaceX_Machine_Learning_Prediction_Part_5.jupyterlite.ipynb) for predictive analysis.

Also included are [slides](https://github.com/joeastro5/IBM_Capstone/blob/main/ds-capstone-ibm-compressed.pdf) describing in some more detail.
